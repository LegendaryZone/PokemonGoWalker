# Pokémon Go Walker: Computer Vision Script
<img src="main.jpg" width="100%"/>
This project uses machine learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network to detect
game state and Tensorflow's object detection API to detect the state of the game(which menu you are on).

The purpose of this script is to combine these techniques to automate the actions in the hit mobile game
Pokémon Go.

Tasks include identifying and selecing a Pokémon on the map to encounter, throwing a Poké-ball until capture/out of items, 
and spinning Poké-stops to replenish items being used in the process. 

It is understood that automating game tasks is against Niantic's policies and is merely for educational uses.
